# BAE305-SP24Lab
# Lab 1, Knowing your instruments
group members: Terence Redford and Heath Shewmaker
Submission date: (NOT SUBMITTED YET)
# Introduction summary
the aim of this lab was to familiarise ourselves with the details for using common electrical components and circuit analysis tools. The equipment used included Digital multimeters, oscilloscopes function generators and Voltage supplies. we investigated how we can use these tools to get information about resistance and capacitance, and what the limitations and use cases of each tool are. 
this investigation required testing specific components we were given using the tools we had, which showed us that the equipment had specific use cases, for exaple the DMM has an internal resistance, and for AC voltage only reads the root mean square of the signal. furthermore we confirmed that the factory specifications of the resistors and capacitors were accurate.
